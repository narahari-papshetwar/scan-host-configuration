# Scan Host Configuration
    Version: 1.0

## Description
- This utility installs the prerequisites required to run a malware scan on the scan-host(RHEL(8.x, 9.x)/Windows Server 2016 and above).
- Additionally, this utility can be used to install `NetBackup Malware Scanner` on the scan-host.
- The following would be installed by the utility on the scan-hosts
    1. Linux scan-hosts:  Non root user, libnsl, NetBackup_Malware_Scanner using non root user.
    2. Windows scan-hosts:  Non Administrator User, OpenSSH (9.4), NFS-Client, VC Runtime, Configure NetBackup_Malware_Scanner using non Administrator user.

## Prerequisites to be present on the ansible controller node(node on which this utility runs)
- RHEL Version = 8.x, 9.x
- ansible      = 2.16.2 and above
- python       = 3.11.x(required to run ansible 2.16.x)
- sshpass      = 1.x
- pywinrm      = 0.4.x
- requests     = 2.31.x (optional)

> **_NOTE:_** Run `install_ansible.sh` for installing above prerequisites on the ansible controller node.

## Steps to Configure scan-host
    1. Clone the repository from GitHub and move it to your Ansible Control Host:
		git clone https://github.com/scan-host-configuration-using-ansible.git
    2. By default, the host key checking would happen before configuring the scan-host.
        To add the fingerprint of the scan-host for <b>linux</b> hosts do the following:
            1. `ssh-keyscan -H {{HOST}} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts` or Do SSH to the scan-host
    3. Provide the scan-host details in the `inventory/hosts.yml` file.
        `avira_package_path`: Local absolute path to the `NetBackup_Malware_Scanner` zip package.
        `ansible_user`: scan-host username, This user should be a user with root/Administrator privileges.
        `ansible_ssh_pass`: scan-host password
     > **_NOTE:_** If only the prerequisites are to be installed then set `install_avira` to `False` and you can remove the `avira_package_path` from the `inventory/hosts.yml`.
	4. Run the following command to run the playbook
        ansible-playbook playbook.yml
